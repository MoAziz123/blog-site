- Make sure you compartmentalise components - very useful for async stuff
- Avoid promise hell (async -> await forever -> can do via compartmentalization)
- file storage should be handled via 
- navbar should be placed in every component - or an inherited component so they re-render on login change
- avoid tunnel vision


- must/should/could changes
- maintain a list of changes for each iteration so you don't forget
- for each change - take it to a state of completion, don't round robin it
- any working solution - add to a code snippet manager

PARAMTERISED GET
- client - Axios.get('/http://localhost:8080/posts/' + id)

PARAMTERISED ROUTES
- on router - <link to="/posts/:id"/>

 - on post - componentwillmount -> id = window.pathname.href.split("/")[2]
